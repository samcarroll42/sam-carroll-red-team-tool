This telnet listener uses the functionality of the tcpdump tool to listen for telnet traffic on a network.
This tool will capture traffic origianting from the telnet protocol and output a cleaned-up version of tcpdump's output,
allowing for easy visualization of telnet's unencrypted traffic. 
As this script uses tcpdump, it requires sudo or administrator privileges to run.
To run the script, simply enter its directory and execute the command python3 telnet_listener.py.
